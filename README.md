# Titanic-Dataset-and-Spam-Not-Spam-classifications

This project demonstrates the applicaion of two diffrent algorithms: the k-N Neighbors on the Titanic and the Naive Bayes Classifier on classification of emails as spam or not spam.

K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), can be used for both classiﬁcation and regression problems. It stores all available cases and classiﬁes new cases by a majority vote of its K neighbors. Predictions are made for a new data point by searching through the entire training set for the K most similar instances (the neighbors) and summarizing the output variable for those K instances. This type of algorithm has a few advantages among them beingthe fact that it is an easy to use the algorithm and its quick calculation time.


The Naive Bayes Classifier 
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a statistical classification technique based on the Bayes Theorem. It has high accuracy and speed on large datasets.
This type of classifier takes into account the assumption that the effect of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features
